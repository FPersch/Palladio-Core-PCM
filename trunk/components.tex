What is a software component today?
UML 2.0 (history, UML 1.0 Component = unit of deployment)
-	Encapsulate their contents
-	Are replaceable within its environment
-	Define behaviour in terms of provided and required interfaces

Component contracts lift the Design-by-Contract principle of Meyer (``if a client fulfils the precondition of a supplier, the supplier guarantees the postcondition'' \cite{meyer1992a}) from methods to software components. A component guarantees a set of provided services if all required services are offered by its environment. Design-by-Contract cannot only be applied to functional properties, but also to non-functional properties. Adding Quality of Service (QoS) attributes to the contract, a component service ensures that it provides a certain QoS if its environment offers the required QoS attributes.

So, what is a Software Component?
o	Realisation
-	Component = class(es) ?
-	How to bind provided and required interfaces?
-	How does the component interact with its environment?
o	Quality of Service
-	Assembly, deployment, internal structure
o	Runtime
-	How does the system look like at runtime?
o	Substitutability and Interoperability

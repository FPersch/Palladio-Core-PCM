\section{Introduction}
% Why prediction of quality attributes
--> RR

% Why unified models
--> RR
 
% What is a unified model
--> RR

% Contribution
% Organisation
\section{Groups of Quality Properties}
% introduction of the properties of interest
% grouping by domains:  Which combinations of properties are of interest in the different domains (avionics, telecom, …) 
--> Ivica?

% grouping by architectural views: which architectural views are required for each property
--> RR
% grouping by interelation: Partial order which property depends on which other. Elementary properties contributed to other (less elemantary) properties

\section{Pathes to Unified Models}
% which basic abstractions can be extended / annotated to predict which properties.
% Matrix (formalism, property --> research paper (formalism applied to property))

\section{Existing Unified Models}
% Matrix (list of properties --> formalism)
%Lars Grunske, subsection on SEFT (safety, and ?). 

\section{Outlook: Research Agenda and Limitations}
% how to build unified models for specific combinations of properties
% limitations: which set of properties might be hard to combine into one model?

1. Description of the projects

Palladio.QoSAdaptor: 		
	The main project. Contains configuration and common classes that are 
	also used by the other projects. Furthermore this project contains the 
	meta-data of the patterns.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.CacheTest:	
	Contains a test-build of a generated cache.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.GUI: 	
	Contains the GUI of the pattern selection tool. 			

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.Measurement:
	Contains the client used for measurement and different measurement 
	scenarios.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.PatternDescription:
	Contains classes used for the description of patterns which hold the 
	same information as XML-files that follow the PatternDescription.dtd 
	and a parser for these files.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.QMLComparison:
	Implementation of a tool that compares two QML files in order to detect
	QoS mismatches. Based on these mismatches a selection of patterns is 
	given which are able to correct them.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.Test:	
	Test application which starts the pattern selection tool (GUI) with a 
	given set of patterns.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.TestService:
	A simple service (simulating a service execution using Thread.Sleep())
	component used to test measurement with generated adaptors.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.UnitTest: 	
	UnitTest of all projects.

bin:				
	Contains batch files which start the test applications and qml files
	needed to test the QMLComparison application.

doc:				
	Contains the documentation of the projects generated by Ndoc.

libs:				
	Contains external components and programs used by the projects.

Palladio.QoSAdaptor.sln:
	VS.NET solution containing all Palladio.QoSAdaptor* projects.

Palladio.QoSAdaptorTests.nunit: 
	Nunit project file for the tests in Palladio.QoSAdaptor.UnitTests.

INFO.txt: 
	Information about the context of this software.

README.txt:			
	This file.

2. Building instructions for the measurement tool

- Build Palladio.QoSAdaptor.Measurement.exe using VS.NET
- Copy Palladio.QoSAdaptor.Measurement.exe.config to the same file as the 
  executable. This is necessary, because the .config file is needed by the 
  log4net framework for initialization and it is deleted from the target 
  directory each time the application is build.

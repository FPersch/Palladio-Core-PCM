\section{Component Implementation Description}
\label{sec:ComponentImplementation}

In general, a component model does not provide any information about the inner
structure of its components, since components are regarded as a black box
entities. However, black box components inhibit the analysis of Quality of
Service (QoS) attributes of the system, since important information about the
dependency of these attributes on external services, hardware and software
resources, and the usage profile cannot be specified.  With black box
components, only static QoS contracts, like the QoS Modelling Language (QML)
\cite{frolund1998a}, can be used, but these are not sufficient
for this task. If the required QoS profile of a component cannot be provided by
the environment, the component is likely to work, but with lower quality.
Therefore, we need additional information on the inner component structure to
analyse QoS attributes of a component in dependence on its environment at design
time.

Parametric contracts \cite{TODO:reference} extend the design by contract
principle of software components. They compute the postcondition of a component
using the actual precondition offered by the environment. We state that a
component can be considered as black box if the additional information
used by parametric contracts (a) does not expose intellectual property of
the component vendor and (b) has not to be understood by human users. So, the
additional information is not available for the deployer but tools that
examine it. We distinguish between \emph{basic components} and \emph{composite
components} as two differnt ways of implementating a component.

\subsection{Basic Component}
A basic component is a component that is not further subdived. Its describtion
stores information about how each provided services uses the services
specified by the required interfaces. This describtion of the relation
between provided and required interfaces is calles service effect
specification. In general, a service effect specification defines the
behaviour of a service. This includes the used services, possible call
sequences, and probabilities. The describtion only refers to external services.
This abstracts the internal structure of a basic component and provids only the
needed information.

A finite state machine that represents a service effect specification is shown
in figure \ref{fig:seff}.


\subsection{Composite Component}

Conforms Relation to the Complete Type

Description of the inner component structure. Type? -  In theory there might be
different implementation that conform to the same description as in MDA. But
since in most cases, this is a one to one relationship. We don't care.

            This class is a container for some configuration constants needed by the 
            components in the AdapterGeneration projects.
            IMPORTANT: All links are specified relative to the bin directory in the top
            AdapterGeneration folder. All dll's and executables created by the 
            AdapterGeneration subprojects are therefore assumed to be saved in that folder.

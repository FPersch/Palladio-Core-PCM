Calibration setup:

=== Mit Sensorframework at every call at SEFF === 

Comparison Simulation (10000 measurements) and Protocom (232 measurements): 

Simulation
Number of observations of Sensor Response Time of BRS_usage_scenario: 10000
Mean of Sensor Response Time of BRS_usage_scenario: 3.4953714939463425
Standard-Deviation of Sensor Response Time of BRS_usage_scenario: 0.344682123606783

Protocom 2011-02-08 
Number of observations of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 232
Mean of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 3.6389451283922414
Standard-Deviation of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 0.3501593945947868

Same peaks, but peaks are flatter for Protocom -> more variation. 
The Protocom distribution seems to have an additive offset of about 0.1

Reason: Sensorframewok?

Measure again without all the measurements. 

=== Deactivated Sensorframework ===

Number of observations of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 200
Mean of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 3.69758613063
Standard-Deviation of Sensor Scenario overall defaultUsageScenario: 0.38953878453041335

--> even slower (there was a bit more load on the system, but anyways). So Storing results has no large effect.

change calibration or processing rate?

=== Changed processing rate to 9.62, old CPU calibration files ===

like first run, but less pronounced distribution function. Maybe due to additional load. Fix cores for final measurements.

=== Measure Remote Overhead ===
Remote setup as described in BRS distribution setup.


== Old calibration ==
=== Ohne Sensorframework, old version ==
* Single machine
* closed workload to determine USc and possibly single SEFFs response time. 

Technical Setup: 
* Anne's notebook
* BRSProtocomFlat plugins revision 10010, except for:
** ejb-jar and sun-ejb-jar revision 9928 (i.e. no sun-ejb-jar), and also merged in changes for ejb-jar of revision 9991 and 9992, uncommented Database_IDB__yzOOgKSKEd-ujcVHnT0lvg entry in ejb-jar.


ERGEBNIS:
* Closed Workload dauert ca. 3.5 - 4 s auf einem kalibrierten Rechner, 1 Core.

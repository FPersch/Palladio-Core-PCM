What is a software component today?
UML 2.0 (history, UML 1.0 Component = unit of deployment)
-	Encapsulate their contents
-	Are replaceable within its environment
-	Define behaviour in terms of provided and required interfaces

Corba Component Model
J2EE, COM+

SOFA

Software Engineering Processes (RUP, speziell CBSE etc.)

QoS Prediction models (Trivedi, Balsamo, QoSA Reliability Survey Paper)

Cheesman and Daniels

So, what is a Software Component?
o	Realisation
-	Component = class(es) ?
-	How to bind provided and required interfaces?
-	How does the component interact with its environment?
o	Quality of Service
-	Assembly, deployment, internal structure
o	Runtime
-	How does the system look like at runtime?
o	Substitutability and Interoperability

======================
==== Architecture ====
======================
The webserver is organised in two CoRs (Chain of Responsibility): the first chain contains parsers (IRequestParser) for different kinds of request (IRequest). E. g. FTP-support is intended for further versions of the webserver. Currently the first chain contains a parser for HTTP-requests. The second chain contains IRequestProcessors for each IRequestParser. This means that the HTTP-RequestParser has its own Processors for processing requests. 

According to the Design-Pattern (see "Gamma et al - Design Patterns, Addison-Wesley, München, 1995") the chains start with the very most specifical links, getting more and more general. If a link cannot handle a request it is passed to the CoR-Successor, which in proceeding can try to handle the request. For the case no link can handle a request an error-handler returns an error message.



===================
==== Threading ====
===================
Dispatcher-Component: The webserver consists of three classes of threads:
- The Main-Thread initiates the webserver. It also terminates the webserver.
- PortListener-Threads are started for each port the webserver listens on. These threads accept TCP-requests.
- RequestHandler-Threads are started for each incoming request the PortListener accepts. These threads are the working threads, that handle processing the client-request.

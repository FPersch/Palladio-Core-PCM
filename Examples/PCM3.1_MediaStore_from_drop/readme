This Project includes one base model of the MediaStore Example and four design variants.
* The base Model consists of the default models (default.allocation, default.system, mediastore.repository, mediastore.resourceenvironment). 
Additionally, it includes two different usage models which are used within all design variants.
* Alternative 1 (EA1): has an additional DBCach component
* Alternative 2 (EA2): substitutes the DB component with the Pooling DB Component
* Alternative 3 (EA3): includes an additional DB server
* Alternative 4 (EA4): has an additional encoding component in order to compress all files.

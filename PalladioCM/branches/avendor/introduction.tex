\section{Introduction}
\PARstart{T}{his} is the introduction.
Components are for composition.
Divide and Conquer. Provide a hierarchical structure of a software system.
COTS failed. But Product-Lines work.

Szyperski's Component:
-	unit of independent deployment
-	unit of third party composition
-	has no (externally) observable state
Our focus: Unit of independent deployment, all agree, but nobody knows what it is. - For us, it is more than copying a DLL.

For the Quality of Service prediction of a software architecture, we need a component model with clear semantics and enough information to conduct analyses. Current component models lack these capabilities.

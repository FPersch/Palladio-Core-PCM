This example is an initial version of the case study in the WOSP 2009 submission of Anne, Heiko, Steffen and Ralf on multicriteria optimisation. This (or very similar) has also been used in the Quasoss paper of Anne, Franz and Ralf.

The model can be solved with the PCM versiom 3.1, both with SimuCom and the PCm Solver. 

The original sources can be found on the SVN at paper\2009\Martens_WOSP\BRS and (maybe a little changed) at paper\2009\Martens_Quasoss\BRS

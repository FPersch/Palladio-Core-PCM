This example is the final version of the case study in the WOSP 2009 submission of Catia and Anne on guiltiness of performance antipatterns. It contains an initial system with a number of antipatterns as documented in the paper. In addition, it contains a number of systems in which one of the antipatterns each has been resolved. For example, in the brs-pa3 files, performance antipattern (PA) number 3 has been resolved. 

The model can be solved with the PCM versiom 3.1 and SimuCom. For the PCM Solver, there seems to be a problem.

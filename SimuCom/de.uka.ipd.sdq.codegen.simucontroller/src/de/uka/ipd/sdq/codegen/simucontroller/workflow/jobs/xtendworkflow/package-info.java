 *         Contains workflow jobs needed for code generation. Since the structure of
 * @see de.uka.ipd.sdq.codegen.simucontroller.workflow.jobs.XtendTransformPCMToCodeJob was just an
 *      enumeration of workflow jobs it made sense to source those out into this package.
 *      Furthermore, those jobs can now be used in other scenarios where it is necessary to generate
 *      code from an allocation, system or usage model. An example where this is needed is the
 *      de.uka.ipd.sdq.simucom.rerunsimulation plug-in.

<div class="block">The main purpose of this plug-in is to rerun a SimuCom simulation with the possibility to skip
 unnecessary steps. When using the SimuBench to simulate a model, those model parts get copied to
 a newly created project. After validating these models, the code based on those models is
 created. Other essential steps include the creation of the plugin.xml or MANIFEST.MF. The last
 steps before the actual simulation is started include jobs such as compiling and building the
 generated project and moving it to the simulation dock so that the progress of the simulation is
 visible.</br></br>
 
 When a user only wants to change some of the simulation settings (measurements count, simulation
 time,...) he would have to delete the generated project and run through every single step again.
 This plug-in was developed in order to make changes on the simulation settings and rerun the
 SimuCom simulation without the complete regeneration of the project. In fact, the only jobs that
 are still executed can be seen in de.uka.ipd.sdq.simucom.rerunsimulation.jobs.RerunSimulationJob
 Despite the pure resimulation of a generated project it is possible to regenerate code to a
 certain aspect. A user may want to adjust the allocation, system or usage model which all have
 influences on the code. When specific boxes in the GUI are checked one of these (or all) models
 are regenerated.</br></br>

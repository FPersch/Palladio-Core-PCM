Notes about TypeInferTests.launch
---------------------------------

This file is currently excluded from the pcm build because the emma code coverage interfers with the ANTLr generated code in the pcm package.
Furthermore, this test plugin fragement is more focused on the code in de.uka.ipd.sdq.pcm than on the code in de.uka.ipd.sdq.pcm.stochasticexpressions.tests

Remarks on modelling of CoCoME:

Modelling:
- Introduced a facade component for
	- TradingSystem.Inventory.Data
	- TradingSystem.Inventory.Application
to support business logic for composite structures

Assembly Connectors at requires side of ProductDispatcher are missing

Signatures:
- used int instead of long for all ids in signatures
- All non-primitive and non-collection data types are modeled as CompositeDataTypes
- made TYPE[] data types collection data types with inner composite data type of type TYPE
- Exceptions are not modelled because of a lack of support by analysis tools

SEFFs finished:
- org.cocome.tradingsystem.inventory.application.store:
	- bookSale(SaleTO saleTO)

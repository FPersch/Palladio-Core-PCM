/**
 * Event to proceed the activity of a process. This event requires, that at the
 * time it happens, the current demand of the process is zero, thus all former
 * actions of the process have been finished.
 * 
 * This event can either continue the process directly or execute a delayed
 * action of the process. Delayed actions are activities that are executed by
 * the scheduler (e.g. some housekeeping or asking for access to a passive
 * resource) but require the process to be running. DelayedActions have priority
 * of the proceeding of the process as they have to be finished in oder to
 * continue process execution.

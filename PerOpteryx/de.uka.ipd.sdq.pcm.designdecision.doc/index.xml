Each DegreeOfFreedom has two parts: It links a model element that is the changeable entity in this DegreeOfFreedom, and it specifies a Domain of possible values that the model element can take. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;The actual making of a decision is represented in the Choice element. For a specific candidate architecture, one Choice for each DegreeOfFreedom in the Problem as to be made. The Choice contains a reference to the DegreeOfFreedom that it decides and a reference to a value from the DegreeOfFreedom's Domain that represent the selected value.  See the diagram &quot;Design and Choice&quot; for an overview of DegreeOfFreedom, Domain and Choice.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;All of the above mentioned elements are abstract and are subclassed for the different generic degrees of freedom. For example, the degree of freedom of &quot;component allocation&quot; is represented in the AllocationDegree. See the documentation of each subclass of design decision for details. The diagram AssembledComponentDegree visualises the subclassing for the example degree of freedom of &quot;component selection&quot;. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;" publish:filename="content/_RL.u_MP.z.oE.d2.sB.a2P.oI_L.qA_root.html"/></publish:project>

\section{Component Types}
Is the type defined by its provided and required interfaces?
-	-> This is not true for every case.
-	Provided interfaces only?
-	-> This is not true for every case.

Distinguish between Provided and Complete types. Both have their advantages. They are defined by substitutability. 

During software development components evolve, so there is no clear border between both types.

Different interpretations of required interfaces:
-	can be used, but there can be more (provided type interpretation)
-	can only be used (complete type)
-	has to be used in a predefined fashion (not considered in our case, example: information has to be stored in a database, so the interface of the database must be used.

Conformance between Provided and Complete Types.
